# neuron-survival-sim-py
Continuation of my https://github.com/Xabab/neural-survival-sim but in python. It was rewritten to a working prototype in less than a week, including learning python. It was yet another course work.

Fixed several breaking bugs, now it actually works. You can change different settings in separete text file, called GameConstants.

Still a laggig mess because of Python memory management. I want to rewrite it in C++.
